Hi, my name is **Humberto Rocha Gonçalves Filho**.

I'm a bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** currently working as **CTO/Full Stack Developer** at [Configr](https://configr.com).

I'm also holding the position of **Technology Director** at [Associação Python Brasil (APyB)](https://associados.python.org.br) which is the Python Brazil Association.

As an enthusiast of the **maker culture**, I also participate in [Calango Hacker Clube](http://calango.club), a hackerspace of Brasília.

My best skills are web application development, process and pattern automation, **REST API** design, systems integration and static site creation like this one.

The technologies that I'm fluent are [Python](https://www.python.org), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com), [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Angular](https://angular.io).
